Understand Redux Workflow
Redux revolves around:

State: Centralized store holding your app's data.
Actions: Describes what should happen.
Reducers: Pure functions that determine how the state changes in response to actions.
Dispatch: Sends actions to reducers.
Selectors: Extract specific data from the store.
